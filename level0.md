# **TASK 2: API**
---

### What is an API?
An API (Application Programming Interface) allows two applications to talk to each other.  
It works by sending a request to a server and getting a response back in JSON format.  

---

### Crypto Tracker
I built a simple **Crypto Tracker Web App** using the **CoinGecko API**.  
The user can search for a cryptocurrency and get details like:  
- Price in INR  
- 24h Change (green or red)  
- Market Cap

# **TASK 16: Datasheet Report Writing – MQ135 Gas Sensor**
---

### Introduction
In this task, I studied the **MQ135 gas sensor datasheet** and documented its working principle, calibration, and behavior.  

---
### Report
- **MQ135** is a **SnO₂-based semiconductor air-quality sensor** with a heated element whose resistance (Rs) changes with gas concentration.  
- Operates at **5 V**, uses a **load resistor (RL)** for readout, and is sensitive to **NH₃, CO₂, alcohol, benzene, smoke,** and others.  
- **Calibration** follows log–log curves, normalized to R₀ at reference conditions, mapping Rs/R₀ to ppm. Ambient temperature and humidity affect Rs as shown in datasheet plots.  
- **Multi-gas sensitivity curves** exhibit power-law behavior compatible with the **Freundlich adsorption model** on SnO₂.  
- This explains the **non-linear response** of the sensor and helps improve empirical fitting for real-world gas estimation.  

---
### Sources
- [Olimex MQ135 Datasheet](https://www.olimex.com/Products/Components/Sensors/Gas/SNS-MQ135/resources/SNS-MQ135.pdf)  
- [Winsen MQ135 Manual](https://www.winsen-sensor.com/d/files/PDF/Semiconductor%20Gas%20Sensor/MQ135%20(Ver1.4)%20-%20Manual.pdf)

---
### VR vs AR
- **Virtual Reality (VR):** Creates a completely digital environment that replaces the real world. A headset is used to enter this immersive space.  
- **Augmented Reality (AR):** Adds digital elements on top of the real world. For example, AR can show digital objects through a phone camera while still seeing the surroundings.  

---
### Current Trends
- VR is being used in **gaming, education, healthcare, and simulations**.  
- AR is popular in **retail, navigation, and training applications**.  
- Technology stacks are evolving with **lighter headsets, better graphics, and 5G-enabled experiences**.  

---
### Conclusion
